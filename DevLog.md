In main: 
- Extract the parsing of the weights into its own function, then module
- Replace Database weight with TRRUST
    - Problem - TRRUST does not have data for yeast
    - Problem #2 - all the other databases we found with Joel are for humans and mice
    - we could technically purify the direct relationships by performing correlation mapping
    and then structure clearing for yeast TF network
- We can as well replace the structural topology with the TFs from Yeast or pure P2P
